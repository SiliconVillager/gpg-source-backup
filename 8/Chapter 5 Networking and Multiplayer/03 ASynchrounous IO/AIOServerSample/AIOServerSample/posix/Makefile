# This Makefile handles building the platform specific files in this
# directory. The default target (ALL) delegates back up to the parent 
# Makefile, so when used recursively this Makefile should always be 
# called with a specific target.
#
# To ensure consistent build flags, CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS should be passed
# to this Makefile when used recursively.

.cpp.o :
