This is the beginnings of a README file.

MathGL++ C++ library:
--------------------------------------

This build of MathGL++ is at alpha status, keep this in mind.
If stability is key, download the 0.5 version of MathGL++; it is fairly stable
and currently has no known bugs.

Known bugs:
 * FreeBSD 6.* seems to need ./configure CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/X11R6/include' to build properly, for some reason the X11 include are not in the standard includes with XPATH.

What are the experimental parts of this version (0.6.x):

 * Matrix.h:
    - A row major 2D matrix class for image processing and the like.
      Currently very unstable, use with caution.

 * LinearPolynomial.h:
    - A fortran style linear polynomial solver. Very handy for all sorts of
      optimisation problems. This class should be fairly stable.

 * Cubic polynomials:
    - There are multiple sorts avialable here. Bezier, Hermite.



Other languge bindings:
---------------------------------------

The Python bindings are now in a subfolder named pymathgl.

Build and install MathGL++. Then enter the pymathgl directory.
Type 'python setup.py build' ,then su to root and type 'python setup.py install'.
You should then have the Python bindings installed.
