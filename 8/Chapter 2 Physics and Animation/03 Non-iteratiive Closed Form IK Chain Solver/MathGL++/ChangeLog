-- Version 0.5 pre1

   This is a 0.5 pre-release snapshot of current development. It has not been thoroughly tested, there is still no MS package. Next time I promise... :-)
   0.5 will mainly be a feature add release moving towards hopefully a beta stage in 1.0.
   Increased ease of use and more features is thus the basic gist of it :-).
   Don't forget to send in bug reports to the SF.net site.
 
2005-01-10  <>
	Added GLMatrix determinant, cofactors & adjoint. 
	Added GLQuaternion to GLMatrix conversion. 
	Added GLMatrix equality check & element access. 
	Added <iostream> interface for GLMatrix. 
	Added unittest for GLMatrix. 
	 

2004-11-13  <>
	Added documentation to the GLQuaternion class. 

-- Version 0.4

  The main change is for Unix users. The default include prefix is now include/MathGL++ and
  there is now a mathglpp-config script that should be used for c & linker flags.
  There is still no MSVisualC++ project for this package but users have reported success with
  just including the files directly in their own project. Since this software library is licensed under
  the LGPL that is totally OK.

  GLPlane has been added.
    - Plane shadow matrix to come.

  Quaternions are up to a good standard now.

  BernsteinPolynomials are in and working though maybe not as fast as they should.
    - Cubic spline specialisation to come.

  Matrix has gotten many improvments thanks to Sebastien Bloc (his details are in the CONTRIBUTORS file)
  as well as the Vector class.

  Enjoy. Jacques.

CVS log between version 0.3 and 0.4:

2004-11-05  <>
    Implemented more of Sebastien Bloc's patch and fixed error in applyTranslate.

2004-11-05  <>
    Fixed bug in loadOrtho and added Quaternion unit method and Matrix view matrix method.

2004-11-03  <>
    Changed order in change log

2004-11-03  <>
    Added GLPlane.

2004-11-03  <>
    Added mathglpp-config script and fixed ifdef problem with mathgl_pp for users without SDL.

2004-11-03  <>
    Moving the include prefix to include/MathGL++

2004-11-01  <>
    Added changes from Sebastien Bloc and optimized vector and matrix routines.


-- Version 0.3

  The API for GLVector has changed slightly.
  The dimension is no longer a template argument. There are now 3 Vector classes,
  GLVector2, GLVector3 and GLVector4. This was due to minor differences between the
  classes that made the classes less usable as a generic type.
  Constructors and set methods are now easier to use.

  Also the specialisations are now in a lib to avoid multiple definition errors.
  So to use MathGL++ now you must add -lmathglpp to your LDFLAGS (or whatever you use).

  Some more fixes as well.

  Vector:
    + multiply and divide by scalar.
    + cross product.
    + GLfloat instead of float and GLdouble instead of double.

  Quaternion: in pre-release stage.

  Plane: in pre-release stage

-- Version 0.2

  This second release of MathGL++ contains the same as version 0.1 with some bugfixes.

  Additions:

   Matrix:
    + transpose.
    + vectored vertex submission for top-speed software transforms.
    + fixed some minor bugs.

  Also, the example is now a bit more exciting, showing off a bit more of MathGL++.

-- Version 0.1

  This is a first release of MathGL++. It contains a vector and a matrix class.

  Features:

   Matrix: All complete except for
    - eigenvalue/eigenvector calculation.
    - transpose
    - adjoint etc.
    - inverse.
    - determinant

   Vector: All done.

   Quaternion: Not in yet.

   Plane: Not in yet.

   Polynomials: Not in yet.
